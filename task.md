## Develop a web application developed with React framework for video bookmarking.

### The web application should support the following features:
- ability to upload video from local storage or via web links (google drive, etc.)
- media player, which allows viewing of the selected video
- sidebar with the ability to add text notes to specific time intervals
- ability to download text notes in the format of your preference (JSON, YAML, XML, etc.)
- ability to import/apply previously saved notes to the video
  The web application should be deployed to any of the modern cloud services. We suggest using
  Heroku for free deployment or free credit provided by the Google Cloud Platform.

### Deliverables
- GitHub repository with code and configurations
- descriptive Readme file with clear instructions on how to set up the system locally
- link to the web application
- basic description of the system(1-2 paragraphs)
